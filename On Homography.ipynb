    "where $\\matrix{H_{3\\times3}}' = \\frac{s}{z} \\matrix{H_{3\\times3}}$. We could have solved Eq. \\ref{eq:incorrect_homography} using DLT. One trivial solution for $h_{31}'$, $h_{32}'$ and $h_{33}'$ would be: $h_{31}' = 0$, $h_{32}' = 0$ and $h_{33}' = 1$. Unfortunately this method is not valid and will give incorrect results because while $\\matrix{H_{3\\times3}}$ is independent of point coordinates, $\\matrix{H_{3\\times3}}'$ is not and is dependent on $z$ coordinate of each point, which in turn is dependent on $X$ and $Y$ coordinates of each point, which are bound to be different. The only time this method will work is when $z$ value of every point on the plane is the same, i.e. in case of imaging a checkerboard pattern, the pattern is parallel to the camera's image plane. In that case, the last row of homography will be $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$."
